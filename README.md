## Introduction

- JAlgoArena Auth allows for creation of account, login in using username and password, authenticating using previously received token or just taking information about users of JAlgoArena.
- On the first run of the service - it creates admin account with _admin_ as username, and password put into logs
- Submissions service talks directly with Auth service to make sure users are authenticated and they have required roles

## Running locally

There are two ways to run it - from sources or from binaries.

### Running from binaries
- go to [releases page](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Auth/releases) and download last app package (JAlgoArena-Auth-[version_number].zip)
- after unpacking it, go to folder and run `./run.sh` (to make it runnable, invoke command `chmod +x run.sh`)
- you can modify port in run.sh script, depending on your infrastructure settings. The script itself can be found in here: [run.sh](run.sh)

### Running from sources
- run `git clone https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Auth` to clone locally the sources
- now, you can build project with command `./gradlew clean bootRepackage` which will create runnable jar package with app sources. Next, run `java -Dserver.port=9999 -jar build\libs\jalgoarena-auth-*.jar` which will start application
- there is second way to run app with gradle. Instead of running above, you can just run `./gradlew clean bootRun`
