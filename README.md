## Introduction

- JAlgoArena Auth allows for creation of account, login in using username and password, authenticating using previously received token or just taking information about users of JAlgoArena.
- On the first run of the service - it creates admin account with _admin_ as username, and password put into logs
- Submissions service talks directly with Auth service to make sure users are authenticated and they have required roles

## Components

- [JAlgoArena](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena)
- [JAlgoArena UI](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-UI)
- [JAlgoArena Submissions (and Ranking)](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Submissions)
- [JAlgoArena Eureka Server](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Eureka)
- [JAlgoArena API Gateway](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-API)

## Continuous Delivery

- initially, developer push his changes to GitHub
- in next stage, GitHub notifies Travis CI about changes
- Travis CI runs whole continuous integration flow, running compilation, tests and generating reports
- coverage report is sent to Codecov
- application is deployed into Heroku machine

## Infrastructure

- Heroku (PaaS)
- Xodus (embedded highly scalable database) - http://jetbrains.github.io/xodus/
- Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Eureka Client)
- TravisCI - https://travis-ci.org/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Auth

## Running locally

There are two ways to run it - from sources or from binaries.

### Running from binaries
- go to [releases page](https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Auth/releases) and download last app package (JAlgoArena-Auth-[version_number].zip)
- after unpacking it, go to folder and run `./run.sh` (to make it runnable, invoke command `chmod +x run.sh`)
- you can modify port and Eureka service url in run.sh script, depending on your infrastructure settings. The script itself can be found in here: [run.sh](run.sh)

### Running from sources
- run `git clone https://github.com/spolnik/JAlgoArena-Auth` to clone locally the sources
- now, you can build project with command `./gradlew clean bootRepackage` which will create runnable jar package with app sources. Next, run `java -Dserver.port=9999 -jar build\libs\jalgoarena-auth-*.jar` which will start application
- there is second way to run app with gradle. Instead of running above, you can just run `./gradlew clean bootRun`
